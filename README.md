# other_configs

This repository is about other configurations that I need for several applications 

### Applications:

- GVim
- VS Code
- Windows Terminal 
- Git Bash
- PowerShell 7
- Alacritty
- Wezterm
- Tmux

### Notes GVim

To edit GVim write the command in $home
`:edit _vimrc`
That creates a _vimrc file which you will be able to modify
